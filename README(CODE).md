4_RandomForest.py
Python version: Python 3.11.5
Package: numpy 1.26.4, pandas 2.2.2, matplotlib 3.8.4, scikit-learn 1.4.2, shap 0.45.0,scikit-optimize 0.10.2

This script implements a Random Forest model for data preprocessing and optimization, incorporating spatial clustering, 
multicollinearity analysis, feature importance assessment, and generating explainable visual outputs like SHAP values and 
Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs). The primary focus is on predicting forest defoliation(deviation) using nested cross-validation with the 
Random Forest model (Dev_all).

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load data from a CSV file containing spatial, stand/plot, tree damage, climate,and air pollution variables.
 Climate and air pollution data are available at three primary datasets:
 Climate data were obtained from two primary sources: SPEIbase v2.9, provided by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and accessible at https://spei.csic.es/; 
 and the ERA5-Land dataset, produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and available through the Copernicus Climate Data Store at https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/dataset. 
 Additionally, air pollution data were sourced from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), which can be accessed at https://emep.int/. 
   - Define target (`Dev_all`) and selected features for modeling.
   - Rename columns for better readability and usability.
2. Multicollinearity Analysis**:
   - Compute Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) for selected features.
   - Identify features with VIF > 5, which indicates potential multicollinearity issues.
3. Spatial Clustering**:
   - Apply KMeans clustering on longitude and latitude data to spatially group samples.
   - Visualize clustering results using 2D and 3D scatter plots.
4.Block Nested Cross-Validation with Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Use Bayesian Optimization (`BayesSearchCV`) to tune Random Forest hyperparameters.
   - Implement a custom scoring function to penalize overfitting by considering the difference between training and validation R² scores.
   - Conduct nested cross-validation to evaluate model performance using metrics such as R², RMSE, and MAE.
5. Model Training on Full Dataset and Interpretability**:
   - Train the final Random Forest model on the entire dataset using the best hyperparameters and selected features.
   - Generate and save feature importance plots to rank variable influence.
   - Create Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) to visualize the relationships between features and the target variable.
   - Calculate SHAP values for detailed interpretability and generate summary and beeswarm plots.
7. Feature Importance and Selection**:
   - Calculate feature importance scores to prioritize variables.
   - Perform stepwise feature selection by iteratively removing less important variables and tracking performance.
8. Refined Model Training with Reduced Features**:
   - Retrain the Random Forest model on the reduced feature set with optimized hyperparameters.
   - Perform a final nested cross-validation to validate the optimized feature set.
9. Visual Outputs**:
   - Feature Importance: Save and visualize feature importance for model interpretability.
   - Partial Dependence Plots: Generate PDPs for the reduced feature set to understand the impact of each feature.
   - SHAP Analysis: Generate SHAP values, correlation metrics, and beeswarm plots to understand feature contributions.
10. Important output csv
    - Cross-validation results (`outer_cv_results.csv`, `inner_cv_results.csv`).
    - Selecte best hyperparameters(`best_params_overall.csv`).
    - Selected feature set and corresponding metrics (`selected_best_features.csv`).
    - Final model performance metrics (`average_reduced_features_results.csv`).
